            Emphasize One or More. Incorporate All.</h3>

            Concerto allows one type of message to be highlighted amongst a huge pool of different messages. Concerto
            messages are organized into categories called feeds, which can be mixed and matched differently on each
            separate Concerto display to cater to distinct locations and audiences.</p>

            Because Concerto lives on the World Wide Web, any device that can be connected to the Internet can
            potentially display Concerto. That means that flat panel televisions, mobile phones, personal screensavers,
            and other websites can all serve as hosts for your exciting announcements.</p>

        <p>
            Concerto is the perfect model for grassroots communication. The software is fully open source, so you can
            use and deploy it for free. Because of the affordable hardware prices and Concerto&rsquo;s flexible
            architecture, many different organizations (with different budgets) can help grow your Concerto network.</p>

                Concerto started at a well-known, private technological university in the United States. While this
                certainly isn&rsquo;t the only place where Concerto can be implemented to great effect, it&rsquo;s easy
                to realize the benefits of a Concerto network by peering into life Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
                (RPI) with Concerto.</p>

                Case in Point: The RPI Story</h1>
            <p>
                Concerto launched at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in March 2008. A group of plucky students saw the
                opportunity to bring the open source Concerto software to their school, and made a proposal that was
                endorsed by their Student Union. The Union gave them some funds under the supervision of an
                extracurricular student organization. The seed funding allowed the students to buy their first screen,
                along with an inexpensive computer built from commodity parts.</p>
            <p>
                With their first screen online, the students were able to convince many other organizations and
                departments to fund Concerto displays in other high-traffic parts of campus. Screens were installed in
                many areas where people walk or stand in line, including dining halls, main thoroughfares, and the
                Bookstore. To these organizations, the benefits of connecting people with their messages and
                incorporating messages from other on-campus groups were numerous, and more than justified the costs of
                buying and installing the hardware. Here are a couple examples:</p>

                The <a href="http://union.rpi.edu" target="_blank">Rensselaer Union</a> funded the first screen in the
                network. With the help of the student founders, Union staff members created one feed for entertainment
                promotions, such as flyers for concerts, plays, movie nights, and dance recitals. Another feed was
                created for service and community, such as community service days, multicultural celebrations, and club
                meetings. Now, student club officers and staff members work together to moderate content that is sent to
                Concerto on the Web by other students.</p>

                        Concerto is an essential advertising tool to promote events to the student body. With just a
                        couple mouse clicks, a student user can get their message up on the Union&rsquo;s own screen and
                        others all around campus. They save paper and time, as there&rsquo;s no longer much need to
                        print out and tape up flyers all over campus. Plus, the Union ensures an end to clutter, since
                        Concerto gives equal importance to every message displayed from the Club Events and
                        Entertainment feeds.</p>

                        The Student Union granted $1500 to the student founders&rsquo; organization. This covered the
                        purchase and installation of a 42-inch LCD TV and shoebox-sized computer to pump the visual
                        display to the screen. The computer itself was just over $300 and entirely composed of commodity
                        computer hardware from a common Internet vendor.</p>

            <p>
                The Athletics Department saw potential in using Concerto for their events right from the beginning.
                These people, who promote sporting events to the entire campus and surrounding community, use Concerto
                to bolster their advertising efforts, announcing upcoming game schedules and special ticket promotions

                    <p>
                        On the newly created Athletics feed, the Department makes available a large amount of
                        sporting-related announcements. Department communications personnel simply turn some of the
                        graphics from their sports flyers into digital announcements for Concerto, which they then
                        upload directly from their computers. Since they already moderate the feed, it takes just
                        minutes to get messages up on Concerto. And they also receive intramural athletics content from
                        other staff and students, allowing them to be in constant contact with that other important
                        component of RPI sports.</p>

                        The Athletics Department will be christening a new athletics facility in October 2009. Concerto
                        offers unique possibilities for connecting the new facility with the rest of campus, since it
                        will also stream content from the campus that is unrelated to athletics information (but still
                        important to the people who will be in the building).</p>

                        <p>
                            Public Safety certainly uses email and conventional websites to keep people informed, but
                            Concerto provides an immediate communications channel that students like to see as they walk
                            to class and the dining halls. And since Concerto was initiated at RPI by a student group,
                            there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Ivory Tower&rdquo; effect. The medium is governed jointly by
                            students, staff, and faculty, and that kind of stewardship really resonates with everyone.
                            Most importantly, Concerto has an emergency mode that allows the University to override all
                            live content in the rare event of an emergency. Concerto pulls emergency notices from a
                            secure website and accompanies the display with an audible alert. Emergency notices can be
                            campus-wide or building-specific.</p>

                        The Lally School was attracted to Concerto because of how the software can integrate them in

                        uploaded to Concerto from the Student Union, Athletics Department, and Career Center, and they
                        also promote their own stuff to everyone else. Setting up their two screens for their specific
                        audiences (i.e. management majors) is simple: a staff member just logs into the Concerto Panel
                        at an easily accessible web address, clicks on a screen, then selects which content feeds to
                        place on that screen. So they have the following feed subscriptions on the lobby screens:</p>

                    gets on with its daily life. The screensaver allows each user to pick out the types of feeds with
                    which they&rsquo;re most interested &ndash; maybe Athletics and Entertainment, or maybe Club Events
                    and Career Workshops for the future movers and shakers of America.</p>

                Concerto launched 14 months ago, and since then, well over 800 people with RPI web accounts have logged
                in and used Concerto to upload one or more ads. They can specify takedown dates automatically for each
                ad and design graphics for the network using common image editing software (or Powerpoint, which is also
                just fine). Concerto at RPI has hosted over 3,000 unique messages, giving the campus community a fresh
                dose of university and world news, promotions, and notices.</p>
