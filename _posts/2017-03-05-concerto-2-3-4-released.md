Some weeks back, we released [Concerto 2.3.4](https://github.com/concerto/concerto/releases/tag/2.3.4). This release contains fixes for many bugs and updates to the calendar and weather plugins. For the full list of changes,Â [compare the commits](https://github.com/concerto/concerto/compare/2.3.3...2.3.4) between this release and 2.3.3. Of note, this release contains fixes for how we upload graphics, particularly disabling the submit button while a graphic is uploading. We have also enabled content to have custom edit forms. At this moment Ruby 2.4 is not supported in this version of Concerto. We are targeting it for 2.3.5. Please look forward to it.
