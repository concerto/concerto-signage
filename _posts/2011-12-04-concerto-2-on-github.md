We&#8217;ve decided to use <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation" target="_blank">Github Issues</a> to track Concerto 2 development.  We&#8217;ll be using the issue tracker and milestone system on our Concerto 2 Issues page to log all defects that are found with the software as we continue to develop, and also to plan out and share strategic objectives of our Concerto 2 roadmap.  We hope that by organizing everything in one place, right next to the Concerto 2 codebase, it will be much easier to keep tabs on our forthcoming release.

To view the Concerto 2 Issues tracker, <a href="https://github.com/concerto/concerto/issues" target="_blank">click here.</a>  You can also peruse the codebase <a href="https://github.com/concerto/concerto" target="_blank">here</a>.

Right now, we&#8217;re bringing together a <a href="https://github.com/concerto/concerto/wiki/Requirements-%28v2.0%29" target="_blank">Requirements wiki page</a> to keep track of all of our high-level requirements for v2.  We&#8217;ll be gradually turning those requirements into issues within our Github tracker.
