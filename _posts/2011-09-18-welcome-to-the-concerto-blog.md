We have relaunched the home site of the Concerto Digital Signage Project, <a title="Concerto Digital Signage" href="/" target="_blank">http://www.concerto-signage.org</a>, on a new server and new content management application.  This relaunch will allow us to keep the site better updated with information about the first version of Concerto and the forthcoming sequel, <a title="Concerto 2 @ Github" href="http://github.com/concerto/concerto" target="_blank">Concerto 2</a>.

In addition, we&#8217;ve added a real blog for the Concerto Project, which you&#8217;re now reading.  As a team, we want to keep you updated with the latest happenings in the world of Concerto, and this blog will be the destination for posts about many kinds of topics relevant to the project: development updates, the digital signage landscape, how Concerto is being used around the world, and updates from the Concerto community at large.  We want the blog to be a gathering place for all of us.  I&#8217;m sure the future will be very exciting!

Those of us writing for the blog will do our best to keep it updated regularly.  We urge you to hit up the comments section and get involved!
