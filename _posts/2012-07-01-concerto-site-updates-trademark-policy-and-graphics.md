Interested in using the Concerto logo or name for another website, application, or publication?  We&#8217;ve added the <a title="Concerto Trademark Policy" href="http://www.concerto-signage.org/pages/trademark-policy" target="_blank">Concerto Trademark Policy</a> to our website.  This policy clarifies the usage of the Concerto identity and brand.  Check it out and let us know if you have any questions or comments about the policy!

In addition, we&#8217;ve added a new page to the site covering <a title="Concerto Logo and Graphics" href="http://www.concerto-signage.org/pages/logos-and-graphics" target="_blank">Logos and Graphics</a>.  Here you can download PDF and PNG versions of our official project logo, in blue (the default colorset), black, and white (for cases where the logo appears above colored backgrounds).  We&#8217;ll be adding more information to both pages over the coming weeks, but we hope they are helpful to the Concerto community right from the start.
