Concerto 2 development continues to progress at a blistering pace! In just a little over two months (67 days for anyone counting), the Concerto team has released a second beta version &#8211; 0.2.0 &#8220;DeltaOcelot&#8221;. Perhaps even better news is that development pace shows no signs of slowing down and new versions can be expected on an increasingly frequent schedule. To get started head over to our installation guide [here](https://github.com/concerto/concerto/wiki/Installing-Concerto-2).

DeltaOcelot brings three entirely new and compelling features to the table. Support has been added for Vimeo videos. Youtube support is nice, but isn&#8217;t for everyone and options are always nice! Ticker text now supports basic HTML which should prove useful in distinguishing ticker text items of various importance. Finally, an activity feed has been added to help users quickly view pertinent information and updates.

In addition to new features, there are improvements to existing ones as well. Weather locations can now be specified by WOEID. The group management interface has been redesigned to be easier to use. Graphic caching has been improved, as has security. Finally, no incremental beta would be complete without an ample supply of bug fixes.

Please get in touch with us via our [group](https://groups.google.com/group/concerto-digital-signage) or [issue tracker](https://github.com/concerto/concerto/issues) if you come across a bug or have a feature suggestion for us.  You can find a full list of code changes for this “0.2.0 deltaocelot” beta release [here](https://github.com/concerto/concerto/compare/0.1.0.charliehorse...0.2.0.deltaocelot).
