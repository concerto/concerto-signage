The Fall [update](http://googletv.blogspot.com/2011/10/update-on-google-tv.html) to the Google TV brought the Android Market to Google TV devices, allowing developers to write and publish applications for some digital-signage sized screens.  If you&#8217;re looking to run some digital signage on your Google TV you&#8217;re in luck, you can find a [Concerto app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.concerto.concertotv) in the Market today!

Concerto for the Google TV lets you configure and connect to a Concerto server, letting you specify a server URL and customize a MAC address as needed.  If you&#8217;re interested in tweaking your server slightly, the device will also pass the current screen width and height as parameters in the initial URL.  If you&#8217;re having trouble sizing the screen manually like traditional Concerto v1 screens, you can use these to automatically set the size of the screen so content will render appropriately.

Don&#8217;t have a Concerto server but still want to check out a Concerto player?  The app comes pre-configured to connect to automagically connect to a demo server and pull in some [dynamic content](/help_pages/39)  keeping the information fresh.

The source code for the application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/concerto/concerto_gtv), and I encourage you to report any [issues](https://github.com/concerto/concerto_gtv/issues) you run into.
