As part of Concerto 2 we are completely rewriting the front end of the system, overhauling the JavaScript that powers the screens to be significant better structured so it&#8217;s easier to maintain, extend, and just play around with.  There will probably be fewer inappropriate [comments](https://github.com/concerto/concerto_v1/blob/master/screen/signage.js#L213) as well (though we haven&#8217;t yet started to work on the automatic text-resizing problem yet&#8230; no promises).

Right now we&#8217;re developing the new front end using Google&#8217;s [Closure Library](http://code.google.com/closure/library/), which will let us reap the benefits of well-structured object oriented JavaScript and minify really well using the Closure Compiler.  There isn&#8217;t as much documentation out there for the library as there are for many other tools like jQuery, Coffeescript, or Backbone.js but I was quite satisfied with the results when I used it for another project.  It seems to provide strong interfaces to lots of HTML5 components that we&#8217;d like to take advantage of as we push towards having offline capabilities and more interactive screen experiences.

If you&#8217;re curious about the technical details, the core of the frontend is a 5 layer cake.  I can&#8217;t draw a picture of a cake, but I can describe it in words.  At the bottom we have the **Screen**, which is really just used to encapsulate the whole process in one object and provide a standard connection interface to talk back to the Concerto server.  On top of the Screen we draw a **Template**, which right now consists of a huge image background (perhaps it could be HTML-based in the future) and bunch of **Positions**.  Each position represents one block on the screen, you see them in the backend when you&#8217;re previewing templates that show where your content will go.  Positions have a location to be shown and some styles, but most importantly they have a **Field**.  A field is where the **Content** ends up getting fetched, rendered, and transitioned into place.  They do most of the heavy lifting after the initial HTML scaffolding is setup.

To recap:** Screen > Template > Positions > Field > Content.**

In Concerto 1 there isn&#8217;t really any sort of layered cake in use, it&#8217;s much more like a fruitcake.  You can kind of see the different bits and pieces if you look really hard, but it&#8217;s mainly one big monolithic structure.

What does this mean besides a lot of extra files to manage when you&#8217;re working on the frontend?  Well for starters it let me refactor the code base to support what we call &#8220;mini screens&#8221; in about 20 minutes.  A mini screen is just that, a small screen that doesn&#8217;t take over the entire window.  You can see one when you visit http://concerto.rpi.edu right on the homepage, but in V1 that shares a completely different codebase (with an included memory leak for IE users) than the actual screen frontend.  Not so in Concerto 2, you can have a lot of screens on the same page without any additional work.
