Today&#8217;s release of Concerto 2.2.5 will likely be the last in the 2.2 series. It comprises a large contribution to the state of internationalization in Concerto, CSS to remove the cursor from the frontend, and numerous bugfixes. This is thanks primarily to the contribution of code and suggestions from our wonderful user community.

The 2.3 release, which will hopefully be along soon as our team members work to familiarize themselves with the new framework and toolchain we&#8217;re using to architect the frontend. Our main priority in this respect will be having a performant frontend that doesn&#8217;t leak memory (which has led to crashes on low powered computers) and is feature-equivalent to our previous frontend incarnations.
